## General
At least four different sorting algorithms

What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm

How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input

What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Requirements
## General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

All your files should end with a new line

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

You are not allowed to use global variables

No more than 5 functions per file

Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, … is totally forbidden.

In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples

The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sort.h

Don’t forget to push your header file

All your header files should be include guarded

A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.

### More Info
Please, note this format is used for Quiz and Task questions.

O(1)
O(n)
O(n!)
n square -> O(n^2)
log(n) -> O(log(n))
n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
n + k -> O(n+k)
…
Please use the “short” notation (don’t use constants). Example: O(nk) or O(wn) should be written O(n). If an answer is required within a file, all your answers files must have a newline at the end.

## Tests
Here is a quick tip to help you test your sorting algorithms with big sets of random integers: [Random.org](https://www.random.org/integer-sets/)
